# GBM-Amazon

## Overview

This is an Amazon-like storefront made using MySQL and Node. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. 

The entry point is the ```bamazonCustoermjs``` and when it is run, this application will first display all of the items available for sale. The list includes the ITEM_ID, PRODUCT_NAME, and the PRICE of products for sale.
